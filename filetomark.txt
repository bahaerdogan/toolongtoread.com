Global markets start the last trading day of the week with weak risk appetite. The news that Israel carried out an operation against Iran has an impact on prices. While there is a trend towards safe havens, there are losses in the stock markets. Although some statements made by the authorities partially softened the sharp pricing in the early hours, significant losses continue in the stock market indices. US futures are down around 1%. MSCI Asia Pacific index excluding Japan is also declining by approximately 2%. Brent oil is at a 2% premium this morning. On the other hand, the postponement of interest rate cuts in the USA following the latest data was putting pressure on the stock markets. Hawkish statements are also coming from Fed members. Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari said that the Fed may keep interest rates constant this year. Apart from geopolitical developments, it can be said that expectations for the Fed also suppressed risk appetite. Parallel to the outlook in global markets, the BIST100 index may also start the day with a seller's outlook. The emergence of the weekend risk along with the high tension in the Middle East may cause the index, which has been trying to support the 9,500 region for a few days (Yesterday's closing was 9,525), to display a seller's image below the said region today. On the data side, the CBRT's April Market Participants Survey this morning stands out. The international data agenda is calm.
